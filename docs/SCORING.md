Interview Scoring Breakdown

Overview

After the interview concludes, the AI system evaluates the candidate's performance using a structured scoring rubric. It analyzes the full interview transcript alongside response timing, job description, and the candidate's CV.

The evaluation is automated using a prompt that instructs the AI to generate a JSON output containing both category-wise scores and an overall assessment.


Scoring Categories

Each interview is evaluated across the following dimensions (scored 0–10):

Technical AcumenEvaluates the candidate's understanding of relevant technical concepts, tools, and frameworks required for the job.

CommunicationAssesses the clarity, structure, and professionalism in the candidate’s answers.

ResponsivenessMeasures how quickly and appropriately the candidate responds to questions. Delays or evasive answers may lower the score.

Problem SolvingJudges how effectively the candidate handles situational or follow-up questions, including examples or structured thinking.

Cultural FitEvaluates interpersonal tone, values alignment, and how well the candidate's behavior matches the company culture implied by the job description.

Timing Metric: avgResponseTime

Each response is timestamped and compared to the prior AI question to calculate response time (in seconds). The average is then used to:

Supplement the Responsiveness score

Inform reviewers on how efficiently a candidate can think and respond under light pressure

While not directly scored as a category, avgResponseTime appears in the final result object for transparency.


Final Output Format

The AI returns a strict JSON structure like below:
{
  "technical": 7,
  "communication": 8,
  "responsiveness": 6,
  "problemSolving": 7,
  "culturalFit": 8,
  "averageScore": 7.2,
  "avgResponseTime": 5,
  "summary": "The candidate demonstrates strong communication and technical expertise, with room to improve responsiveness in high-pressure scenarios."
}


Notes: 
Scores are not final recommendations, but provide an at-a-glance summary.
All evaluations are driven by a single prompt to the AI API and follow a consistent format across all candidates.
The summary field is a natural language evaluation generated by the AI based on all data provided.
